## Ladan Torkzaban _ Junior Full Stack Software Developer

- I'm a full stack developer who has trained with Makers Academy developing my engineering skills.
- After being a full time mum for few years ,I have decided to refresh my knowledge and memory from what I have studied in university. I joined the Makers academy and achieved an incredible experience in 16 weeks on full stack programming  and testing . I'm skilled in communication and pair programming.I love to challenge myself with learning new skills to keep my brain motivated.

- I have a strong desire to learn code, I love breaking down a project into little piece then used them to build something new out of it,during my coding journey I had this satisfaction as an individual and in a team project. The ability to work in an environment that could build a better future is something I greatly look forward to.

## Personal Skills

#### Quick Learner
- I am good at understanding a concept and use my knowledge to get a project started then build upon that .For example learning Ruby and use it in Bank challenge in my Makers time.Now that I am developing and maintaining software, my enthusiasm is boundless. I am eager to learn as much as possible   and continue improving as a developer. I am excited to work on new challenges, gain new knowledge and use my existing skills to enhance my future projects. 

#### Adaptable and control
- Having coded prior to Makers Academy I was excited to challenge my skills and be open to learning brand new technologies. Few weeks into the course our cohort introduced to JavaScript as well as Ruby,It was a great insight to OOP principles and I was quickly able to adapt and echo my skills onto different projects and technology.

#### Team-Player
- I genuinely enjoy working with others, learning and teaching at the same time  are always great motivators for creating high-quality  projects. The Makers course led us to work on individual and joint projects, and I was comfortable with either arrangement. One of my strengths is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to put forward their ideas so that we identify the best solution most effectively.

#### detail-oriented
- I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details. This comes through in my coding, from seeing how the whole code fits together to finding that one tiny bug.While we had peer group every morning during Makers I used to help my group mate to find those little bugs which stopped their program function well.

## Education

#### UWS Glasgow (2012 to 2018)
- BSc Computer Networking

## Hobbies 

- I started painting from early teenage year , I love water_color painting as much as acrylic, oil, mix media. After my second child I challenged myself to learn calligraphy on canvas which I have combined it with painting .

- I have passion for cooking .I cook every day,my grand_mum was my inspiration at first. I was amazed how she managed to pull out the best taste out of ingredients .After I moved to uk Jamie Oliver opened my eyes to new cooking style since then I like to try different spices with new ingredients to create new tastes.
