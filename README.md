## Personal Strengths

#### Quick Learner
- I am good at understanding a concept and using my knowledge to get a project started and then build upon that.

#### Adaptable and control
- Having coded before Northcoders Academy, I was excited to challenge my skills and be open to learning brand-new technologies. A few weeks into the course, our cohort was introduced to React as well as JavaScript. It was a great insight into OOP principles. Iâ€™ve quickly been able to adapt and echo my knowledge to different projects and technology.
- 
#### Team-Player
-  genuinely enjoy working with others and always finding my place in a team. The Northcoders course led us to work on individual and joint projects, and I was comfortable with either arrangement. One of my strengths is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to put forward their ideas so that we identify the best solution most effectively.

#### detail-oriented
-  I have developed an extremely keen eye for fine details. This comes through in my coding, especially when we had to pair up to find that one tiny bug by seeing how the entire code fit together. I have been able to help my group mate find those little bugs which stopped their program from functioning well.
