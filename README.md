## Personal Skills

#### Quick Learner
- I am good at understanding a concept and use my knowledge to get a project started then build upon that .For example learning Ruby and use it in Bank challenge in my Makers time.Now that I am developing and maintaining software, my enthusiasm is boundless. I am eager to learn as much as possible   and continue improving as a developer. I am excited to work on new challenges, gain new knowledge and use my existing skills to enhance my future projects. 

#### Adaptable and control
- Having coded prior to Makers Academy I was excited to challenge my skills and be open to learning brand new technologies. Few weeks into the course our cohort introduced to JavaScript as well as Ruby,It was a great insight to OOP principles and I was quickly able to adapt and echo my skills onto different projects and technology.

#### Team-Player
- I genuinely enjoy working with others, learning and teaching at the same time  are always great motivators for creating high-quality  projects. The Makers course led us to work on individual and joint projects, and I was comfortable with either arrangement. One of my strengths is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to put forward their ideas so that we identify the best solution most effectively.

#### detail-oriented
- I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details. This comes through in my coding, from seeing how the whole code fits together to finding that one tiny bug.While we had peer group every morning during Makers I used to help my group mate to find those little bugs which stopped their program function well.
